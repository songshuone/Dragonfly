	"content": "This topic explains how to install the Dragonfly server. Tip: For a data center or a cluster, we recommend that you use at least two machines with eight cores, 16GB RAM and Gigabit Ethernet connections for deploying supernodes.\nContext There are two layers in Dragonfly’s architecture: server (supernodes) and client (hosts). Install the supernodes in one of the following ways:\n Deploying with Docker: Recommended for quick local deployment and test. Deploying with physical machines: Recommended for production usage.  Prerequisites When deploying with Docker, the following conditions must be met.\n   Required Software Version Limit     Git 1.9.1+   Docker 1.12.0+    When deploying with physical machines, the following conditions must be met.\n   Required Software Version Limit     Git 1.9.1+   JDK 1.7+   Maven 3.0.3+   Nginx 0.8+    Procedure - When Deploying with Docker  Obtain the source code of Dragonfly.\ngit clone https://github.com/dragonflyoss/Dragonfly.git  Enter the project directory.\ncd Dragonfly  Build the Docker image.\n./build/build.sh supernode  Obtain the latest Docker image ID of the supernode.\ndocker image ls|grep 'supernode' |awk '{print $3}' | head -n1  Start the supernode.\n# Replace ${supernodeDockerImageId} with the ID obtained at the previous step docker run -d -p 8001:8001 -p 8002:8002 ${supernodeDockerImageId}   Procedure - When Deploying with Physical Machines  Obtain the source code of Dragonfly.\ngit clone https://github.com/dragonflyoss/Dragonfly.git  Enter the project directory.\ncd Dragonfly/src/supernode  Compile the source code.\nmvn clean -U install -DskipTests=true  Start the supernode.\n# If the 'supernode.baseHome’ is not specified, then the default value '/home/admin/supernode’ will be used. java -Dsupernode.baseHome=/home/admin/supernode -jar target/supernode.jar  Add the following configuration items to the Nginx configuration file.\nTip: The path of the Nginx configuration file is something like src/supernode/src/main/docker/sources/nginx.conf.\nserver { listen 8001; location / { # Must be ${supernode.baseHome}/repo root /home/admin/supernode/repo; } } server { listen 8002; location /peer { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080; } }  Start Nginx.\nsudo nginx   After this Task  After the supernode is installed, run the following commands to verify if Nginx and Tomcat are started, and if Port 8001 and 8002 are available.\nps aux|grep nginx ps aux|grep tomcat telnet 127.0.0.1 8001 telent 127.0.0.1 8002  Install the Dragonfly client and test if the downloading works.\ndfget --url \u0026quot;http://${resourceUrl}\u0026quot; --output ./resource.png --node \u0026quot;127.0.0.1\u0026quot;  "

	"content": "Dragonfly is an intelligent P2P-based image and file distribution tool. It aims to improve the efficiency and success rate of file transferring, and maximize the usage of network bandwidth, especially for the distribution of larget amounts of data, such as application distribution, cache distribution, log distribution, and image distribution. At Alibaba, every month Dragonfly is invoked two billion times and distributes 3.4PB of data. Dragonfly has become one of the most important pieces of infrastructure at Alibaba.\nWhile container technologies makes DevOps life easier most of the time, it surely brings some challenges: for example the efficiency of image distribution, especially when you have to replicate image distribution on several hosts.\nDragonfly works extremely well with both Docker and PouchContainer in this scenario. It\u0026rsquo;s also compatible with containers of other formats. It delivers up to 57 times the throughput of native docker and saves up to 99.5% of the out bandwidth of registry.\nDragonfly makes it simple and cost-effective to set up, operate, and scale any kind of file, image, or data distribution.\nWhy Dragonfly This project is an open-source version of the Dragonfly used at Alibaba. It has the following features:\nNote: More Alibaba-internal features will be made available to open-source users soon. Stay tuned!\n P2P-based file distribution: By using the P2P technology for file transmission, it makes the most out of the bandwidth resources of each peer to improve downloading efficiency, and saves a lot of cross-IDC bandwidth, especially the costly cross-board bandwidth. Non-invasive support to all kinds of container technologies: Dragonfly can seamlessly support various containers for distributing images. Host level speed limit: In addition to rate limit for the current download task like many other downloading tools (for example wget and curl), Dragonfly also provides rate limit for the entire host. Passive CDN: The CDN mechanism can avoid repetitive remote downloads. Strong consistency: Dragonfly can make sure that all downloaded files are consistent even if users do not provide any check code (MD5). Disk protection and highly efficient IO: Prechecking disk space, delaying synchronization, writing file blocks in the best order, isolating net-read/disk-write, and so on. High performance: Cluster Manager is completely closed-loop, which means that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t rely on any database or distributed cache, processing requests with extremely high performance. Auto-isolation of Exception: Dragonfly will automatically isolate exception nodes (peer or Cluster Manager) to improve download stability. No pressure on file source: Generally, only a few Cluster Managers will download files from the source. Support standard HTTP header: Support submitting authentication information through HTTP header. Effective concurrency control of Registry Auth: Reduce the pressure on the Registry Auth Service. Simple and easy to use: Very few configurations are needed.  How Does It Stack Up Against Traditional Solution? We carried out an experiment to compare the performance of Dragonfly and wget.\n   Test Environment      Dragonfly Server 2 * (24-Core 64GB-RAM 2000Mb/s)   File Source Server 2 * (24-Core 64GB-RAM 2000Mb/s)   Client 4-Core 8GB-RAM 200Mb/s   Target File Size 200MB   Experiment Date April 20, 2016    The expeirment result is as shown in the following figure.\nAs you can see in the chart, for Dragonfly, no matter how many clients are downloading, the average downloading time is always about 12 seconds. But for wget, the downloading time keeps increasing with the number of clients. When the number of wget clients reaches 1,200, the file source crashed and therefore cannot serve any client.\nHow Does It Work? Dragonfly works slightly differently when downloading general files and downloading container images.\nDownloading General Files The Cluster Manager is also called a supernode, which is responsible for CDN and scheduling every peer to transfer blocks between each other. dfget is the P2P client, which is also called \u0026ldquo;peer\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s mainly used to download and share blocks.\nDownloading Container Images Registry is similar to the file server above. dfget proxy is also called dfdaemon, which intercepts HTTP requests from docker pull or docker push, and then decides which requests to process with dfget.\nDownloading Blocks Every file is divided into multiple blocks, which are transmitted between peers. Each peer is a P2P client. Cluster Manager will check if the corresponding file exists in the local disk. If not, it will be downloaded into Cluster Manager from file server.\n"

The pieceSize is calculated as per the following strategy:\n If the total size is less than 200MB, then the piece size is 4MB by default. Otherwise, it equals to the smaller value between (${totalSize} / 100MB) + 2 MB and 15MB.  Next, the peer information along with the task will be recorded:\n The peerwill be saved. The taskwill be saved.  The last step is to trigger a progress.\nResponse An example response:\n{ \u0026quot;code\u0026quot;: 200, \u0026quot;data\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;fileLength\u0026quot;: 687481, \u0026quot;pieceSize\u0026quot;: 4194304, \u0026quot;taskId\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;ba270626349198840d0255de8358b6c93fe6d57d922d036fbf40bcf3499f44a8\u0026quot; } }  Other possible values of code in the response include:\n 606: The task ID already exists. 607: The URL is invalid. 608 or 609: Authentication required.  Get Task GET /peer/task  Parameters    Parameter Type Description     superNode String (IPv4) The IP address of the super node.   dstCID String The destination client ID.   range String Byte range.   status Integer    result Integer    taskId String The task ID.   srcCID String The source client ID.    First, the supernode will analyze the status and result.\n Running: if status == 701. Success: if status == 702 and result == 501. Fail: if status == 702 and result == 500. Wait: if status == 700.  In Wait status, the supernode will save the status to be Running.\nIn Running status, the supernode will extract the piece status:\n Success: if result == 501. Fail: if result == 500. SemiSuc: if result == 503.  Tip: result == 502 suggests invalid code.\nThen the supernode updates the progress for this specific task, and checks the status of the task and the peers. After this, the supernode tells the client which peer has enough details to download another piece. Otherwise, it fails.\nResponse An example resonse:\n{ \u0026quot;code\u0026quot;: 602, \u0026quot;msg\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;client sucCount:0,cdn status:Running,cdn sucCount: 0\u0026quot; }  This example response means that the client has to wait, since no peer can serve this piece now. If there is a peer which can serve this request, the response will be something like:\n{ \u0026quot;code\u0026quot;: 601, \u0026quot;data\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;cid\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;cdnnode:10.148.177.242~ba270626349198840d0255de8358b6c93fe6d57d922d036fbf40bcf3499f44a8\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;downLink\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;20480\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;path\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/qtdown/ba2/ba270626349198840d0255de8358b6c93fe6d57d922d036fbf40bcf3499f44a8\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;peerIp\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;10.148.177.242\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;peerPort\u0026quot;: 8001, \u0026quot;pieceMd5\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;d78ef0af9e95e880fa583b41cf5ad791:687486\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;pieceNum\u0026quot;: 0, \u0026quot;pieceSize\u0026quot;: 4194304, \u0026quot;range\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0-4194303\u0026quot; } ] }  Peer Progress GET /peer/piece/suc  Parameters    Parameter Type Description     dstCID String The destination client ID.   pieceRange String Byte range.   taskId String The task ID.   cID String The client ID.

	"content": "Find the answers to the frequently asked questions. How can I pull images with Dragonfly? See Pulling an Image with Dragonfly.\nHow can I download files with Dragonfly? See Downloading a File with Dragonfly.\nWhat is a supernode? A supernode is a long-time process that plays the following roles:\n A tracker and scheduler in the P2P network that chooses appropriate downloading net-path for each peer. A CDN server that caches downloaded data from source to avoid downloading same files repeatedly.  What is dfget? Dfget is the Dragonfly client used for downloading files. It\u0026rsquo;s similar to wget.\nMeanwhile, it also plays the role of a peer, which can transfer data between each other in the P2P network.\nWhat is dfdaemon? Dfdaemon is only used for pulling images. It establishes a proxy between dockerd/pouchd and registry.\nDfdaemon filters out layer fetching requests from all requests sent by dockerd/pouchd when pulling images, then uses dfget to download these layers.\nWhere is the installation directory of Dragonfly client dfget? Normally, there are two installation directories:\n Dragonfly plugin for StarAgent: /home/staragent/plugins/dragonfly/dfget StarAgent\u0026rsquo;s built-in dfget: /home/staragent/bin/dfget  The Dragonfly plugin is used by default. If the Dragonfly plugin is not installed, then the StarAgent\u0026rsquo;s build-in dfget is used.\nWhere is the log directory of Dragonfly client dfget? The log directory is $HOME/.small-dragonfly/logs/dfclient.log.\nWhere is the data directory of Dragonfly client dfget? The data directory is $HOME/.small-dragonfly/data.\nEach account has its own data directory. A P2P downloading job generates two data files under this directory:\n A temporary downloading file for the target file, with the name targetFileName-sign. This file is moved to the target directory after the download is complete. A copy of the temporary downloading file for uploading, with the name targetFileName-sign.service. If no downloading jobs are downloading this file from this node, then it gets cleaned after three minutes. Before the process is completed normally, any file lasting longer than 60 minutes will be purged.  Where is the meta directory of Dragonfly client dfget? The meta directory is $HOME/.small-dragonfly/meta.\nThis directory caches the address list of the local node (IP, hostname, IDC, security domain, and so on), managing nodes, and supernodes.\nWhen started for the first time, the Dragonfly client will access the managing node. The managing node will retrieve the security domains, IDC, geo-location, and more information of this node by querying armory, and assign the most suitable supernode. The managing node also distributes the address lists of all other supernodes. dfget stores the above information in the meta directory on the local drive. When the next job is started, dfget reads the meta information from this directory, avoiding accessing the managing node repeatedly.\ndfget always finds the most suitable assigned node to register. If fails, it requests other supernodes in order. If all fail, then it requests the managing node once again, updates the meta information, and repeats the above steps. If still fails, then the job fails.\nTip: If the dfclient.log suggests that the supernode registration fails all the time, try delete all files from the meta directory and try again.\nHow to check the version of Dragonfly client dfget? If you have installed the Dragonfly client, run this command:\ndfget -v  Why is the dfget process still there after the download is complete? Because Dragonfly adopts a P2P downloading approach, dfget provides uploading services in addition to downloading services. If there are no new jobs within five minutes, the dfget process will be terminated automatically.\nHow to clean up the data directory of Dragonfly? Normally, Dragonfly automatically cleans up files which are not accessed in three minutes from the uploading file list, and the residual files that live longer than one hour from the data directory.\nFollow these steps to clean up the data directory manually:\n Identify the account to which the residual files belong. Check if there is any running dfget process started by other accounts. If there is such a process, then terminate the process, and start a dfget process with the account identified at Step 1. This process will automatically clean up the residual files from the data directory. "

	"content": "       \nDragonfly is an intelligent P2P-based image and file distribution tool. It aims to improve the efficiency and success rate of file transferring, and maximize the usage of network bandwidth, especially for the distribution of larget amounts of data, such as application distribution, cache distribution, log distribution, and image distribution. At Alibaba, every month Dragonfly is invoked two billion times and distributes 3.4PB of data. Dragonfly has become one of the most important pieces of infrastructure at Alibaba.\nWhile container technologies makes DevOps life easier most of the time, it surely brings some challenges: for example the efficiency of image distribution, especially when you have to replicate image distribution on several hosts.\nDragonfly works extremely well with both Docker and PouchContainer in this scenario. It\u0026rsquo;s also compatible with containers of other formats. It delivers up to 57 times the throughput of native docker and saves up to 99.5% of the out bandwidth of registry.\nDragonfly makes it simple and cost-effective to set up, operate, and scale any kind of file, image, or data distribution.\nWhy Dragonfly? This project is an open-source version of the Dragonfly used at Alibaba. It has the following features:\nNote: More Alibaba-internal features will be made available to open-source users soon. Stay tuned!\n P2P-based file distribution: By using the P2P technology for file transmission, it makes the most out of the bandwidth resources of each peer to improve downloading efficiency, and saves a lot of cross-IDC bandwidth, especially the costly cross-board bandwidth. Non-invasive support to all kinds of container technologies: Dragonfly can seamlessly support various containers for distributing images. Host level speed limit: In addition to rate limit for the current download task like many other downloading tools (for example wget and curl), Dragonfly also provides rate limit for the entire host. Passive CDN: The CDN mechanism can avoid repetitive remote downloads. Strong consistency: Dragonfly can make sure that all downloaded files are consistent even if users do not provide any check code (MD5). Disk protection and highly efficient IO: Prechecking disk space, delaying synchronization, writing file blocks in the best order, isolating net-read/disk-write, and so on. High performance: Cluster Manager is completely closed-loop, which means that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t rely on any database or distributed cache, processing requests with extremely high performance. Auto-isolation of Exception: Dragonfly will automatically isolate exception nodes (peer or Cluster Manager) to improve download stability. No pressure on file source: Generally, only a few Cluster Managers will download files from the source. Support standard HTTP header: Support submitting authentication information through HTTP header. Effective concurrency control of Registry Auth: Reduce the pressure on the Registry Auth Service. Simple and easy to use: Very few configurations are needed.  How Does It Stack Up Against Traditional Solution? We carried out an experiment to compare the performance of Dragonfly and wget.\n   Test Environment      Dragonfly Server 2 * (24-Core 64GB-RAM 2000Mb/s)   File Source Server 2 * (24-Core 64GB-RAM 2000Mb/s)   Client 4-Core 8GB-RAM 200Mb/s   Target File Size 200MB   Experiment Date April 20, 2016    The expeirment result is as shown in the following figure.\nAs you can see in the chart, for Dragonfly, no matter how many clients are downloading, the average downloading time is always about 12 seconds. But for wget, the downloading time keeps increasing with the number of clients. When the number of wget clients reaches 1,200, the file source crashed and therefore cannot serve any client.\nHow Does It Work? Dragonfly works slightly differently when downloading general files and downloading container images.\nDownloading General Files The Cluster Manager is also called a supernode, which is responsible for CDN and scheduling every peer to transfer blocks between each other. dfget is the P2P client, which is also called \u0026ldquo;peer\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s mainly used to download and share blocks.\nDownloading Container Images Registry is similar to the file server above. dfget proxy is also called dfdaemon, which intercepts HTTP requests from docker pull or docker push, and then decides which requests to process with dfget.\nDownloading Blocks Every file is divided into multiple blocks, which are transmitted between peers. Each peer is a P2P client. Cluster Manager will check if the corresponding file exists in the local disk. If not, it will be downloaded into Cluster Manager from file server.\nWho has adopted Dragonfly? Here are some of the adoptors of project Dragonfly.
